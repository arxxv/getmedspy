# getmeds.py

## GetMeds is an android app + web app that helps in delivering medicines to you.

1) If you want some medicines delivered to you, you can create an order on our app and mention the medicines you require along with their quantity. You can also add symptoms to your order if you don't know the medication required to cure your condition. Users can create orders in exchange for coins which serve as a convenience fee.

2) Users can also accept orders available around them and deliver them. When one completes an order they earn coins for completing the order successfully.
